# Project-1a
Project statement - We want to assess how percentage Retail Sales have changed during the COVID pandemic in Australia.

By assessing Covid-19 case number increases by month against different retail industries in Australia, as well as the overall total increase or decrease in sales, we will be able to understand if COVID-19 had an effect on retail spending, and if so, which industries were affected most.
